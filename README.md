## Advanced Algorithms - Assignment 02

Suppose you are given a sorted array A of size N (it contains N integers)
and you have to search for an element x in it. You will first implement two search
algorithms Binary Search and Randomised Binary Search for this, as stated in parts (a) and (b) below, in either Java or Python.

Next you will execute them to perform search operations and report timing results for the
three cases where N=10^5 , 10^6 and 10^7 . For each case, you will perform 1000 searches,
where each search is for a different x. You must have a mix of integers to search for
such that 300 of them are not in the array (which will result in failure of search) and
the remaining 700 integers are spread roughly evenly in A. Then the average of the
time taken for the 1000 searches will give the search time for the case.
